# ReactiveNetworking

ReactiveNetworking is a Cocoa and Cocoa Touch framework for interacting with some API via HTTP, built using
[AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking),
[Mantle](https://github.com/MantleFramework/Mantle), and
[ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa).

Most of the code is shamelessly copied from [Github's OctoKit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.objc).
